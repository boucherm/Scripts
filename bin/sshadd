# "ssh-add and ssh (assuming you are using the openssh implementations) require an environment variable to know
# how to talk to the ssh agent. If you started the agent in a different command prompt window to the one you're
# using now, or if you started it incorrectly, neither ssh-add nor ssh will see that environment variable set
# (because the environment variable is set locally to the command prompt it's set in)."


# ↓ Spawns a new agent everytime...
#eval $( ssh-agent )
#
# ↓ Seems to work better, but won't be working over ssh connections
#ps -A | grep ssh-agent || eval $( ssh-agent )
#
# ↓ Latest attempt, to be tested / verified
ps -A | grep ssh-agent
