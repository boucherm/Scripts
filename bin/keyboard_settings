# Chronicles of an unsucessful attempt to execute this script automatically when plugging the keyboard.
# Was done with udev, followed: https://opensource.com/article/18/11/udev
#
# To see devices plugged / unplugged, run:
# udevadm monitor
#
# Also:
# watch -n1 "ls /dev"
#
# And:
# watch -n1 "tree /dev/input"
#
# Get more infos on the device:
# udevadm info -a -n /dev/hidraw1
#
# Create a udev file:
# /etc/udev/rules.d/80-local.rules
#
# Fill using infos from udevadm info:
# ATTRS{serial}=="06031021AF2D84675AE3BEBEF5001BC6",  ACTION=="add",  RUN+="/usr/local/bin/keyboard_settings"
#
# Called this script in background in the afore-mentioned script â†‘
#
# Reload udev:
# sudo udevadm control --reload
#
# Script did ran, but for some reason the keyboard mods were not applied/effective :(
#
#
#
# Potential workaround:
# Run a background script at startup, which'd call inotifywait ( on /dev/input or something ) and trigger this script/file on changes


#- to get a list of the current mappings use:
# xmodmap -pke
#
#- to get the keycode of pressed keys use:
# xev
#
#--- Set layout
setxkbmap -layout us
#setxkbmap -layout us -variant intl
#
#---- Num Lock
numlockx on &
#xdotool key 77
#
#--- Compose key
#
setxkbmap -option compose:ralt
#
#---- Caps Lock
#
# Disabled, completely, cannot map to another key
#setxkbmap -option caps:none
#
# As ctrl
#setxkbmap -option caps:ctrl_modifier
#
# As F12:
#  .on this machine the caps_lock code is 66,
#   its value can be found with the  "xev" command map caps_lock to F12 in order to use it as the tmux prefix
# . first, disable the caps_lock without losing the key
setxkbmap -option caps:ctrl_modifier
# . second, map the  caps_lock keycode to F12
xmodmap -e 'keycode 66 = F12'
#
#--- Bracket/Brace and parentheses keys
#
#- Switch [ with { and ] with }
xmodmap -e 'keysym bracketright = braceright bracketright'
xmodmap -e 'keysym bracketleft  = braceleft bracketleft'
#
#- Switch "[" with "(" and "]" with ")", I think, to be verified
#keysym bracketleft  = parenleft  braceleft
#keysym bracketright = parenright braceright
#keysym 9            = 9          bracketleft
#keysym 0            = 0          bracketright
#
#
#---- Insert ( disable )
# 118 is the 'insert' keycode
xmodmap -e "keycode 118 ="
